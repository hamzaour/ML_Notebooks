Welcome to my Data Science Project Repository! This repository showcases a range of machine learning techniques applied to real-world datasets. It's structured into four main folders, each containing Jupyter notebooks with detailed code and analysis.

Folder Structure & Contents
1. Basic Machine Learning Techniques
Housing Data Regression Analysis:
Implements linear regression, SVM, KNN, and decision tree models.
Utilizes various scaling and cross-validation techniques.
Breast Cancer Classification:
Based on data from the University of Wisconsin.
Applies logistic regression, SVM, KNN, and decision tree models.
2. Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms
Advanced Regression Techniques:
Features models like Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
Compares performances with simpler algorithms from the first folder.
Advanced Classification Techniques:
Similar approach as the regression notebook, using advanced models for the breast cancer dataset.
3. Neural Networks and Explainability
Neural Network for Regression:
Demonstrates the application of neural networks in regression problems.
Neural Network for Classification:
Focuses on classification with neural networks, applied to the breast cancer dataset.
Includes implementation of explainability techniques.
4. Cluster Analysis
Breast Cancer Dataset Clustering:
Performs cluster analysis on the breast cancer dataset.
Explores data grouping based on features and diagnosis.
